## Hi! I'm MrTalon63

I'm not really a developer by any means. Likewise, I mostly tinker with Discord bots, web apps and electronics.
I absolutely love working with RF. I'm a licensed amateur radio operator and my callsign is SP0KS. I'm mostly active on APRS and sometimes local VHF/UHF.
Furthermore, I'm currently an undergraduate at Silesian University of Technology, majoring in electronics and telecommunications.

If you want to contact me, it's best to email me, as I don't really use X/Twitter or any social media.

Below are some funny autogenerated graphs about my GitHub account.
